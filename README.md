# movefile
This program uses mv to move files

I wrote it as a tutorial just for myself. I think it is helpful if i can explain what i do. 
So i can do an English Version of this, or you could change the file by yourself.
Its my preference how i did this.

Note: For the Directorys you have to put a '/' yourself if needed. Since i won't know when the home directory is used and when another folder is needed. 

I will update this file in English. 

Another Note: To make life easy, just make an alias in your .bash_profile or how i did it in  .bash_shortcuts!
Then you don't have to go to the directory where the mv.py is. :)

It's just so simple!
